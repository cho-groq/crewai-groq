**Summarize any PDF and interact with it through chat ‚Äî powered by Groq + CrewAI.**

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc0c51d0-c6d9-42ae-8550-54938b6a1aca


Built with [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai) and [Groq](https://console.groq.com), this multi-agent research assistant:
- Extracts the raw content of a paper (PDF)
- Generates a readable, structured **summary**
- Extracts and evaluates **key quotes** related to your topic
- Lets you **ask questions about the paper** through an LLM-powered CLI chatbot

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/)
- `uv` (recommended for installing CrewAI)
- A PDF to analyze

---


# File Structure Overview:

- `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` define the Agents' roles and their tasks.
- `crew.py` initializes the agents and tasks from the .yaml files
- `main.py` runs the Agent Crew and the LangChain + Groq Chatbot. 
- `/tools`  is where custom tools agents can use can be created
- `/papers` is where the .pdf file(s) is stored.

### tasks.yaml
- Define what each agent should do
```
pdf_to_txt_task:
  description: >
    Extract and return all the text content from the PDF file located at {file_path}.

# How to Run it

Go into the `latest_ai_development` folder:

`cd latest_ai_development`

Make sure the .pdf file name in `main.py`'s `run` function matches the file name in the /papers folder, and the essay topic is relevant to your essay.
```
def run():
    """
    Run the crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        "file_path": 'src/latest_ai_development/papers/1912.01703v1.pdf', # <----- Change the pdf name
        'topic': 'AI LLMs' # <-----  Change the topic/argument you want to search for in the PDF
